# HypotenuseCalculator

This Java project calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The project demonstrates how to handle user input, perform square root and power calculations, and apply the Pythagorean theorem formula.

## Key Features:
- Take the lengths of two perpendicular sides as input
- Calculate the hypotenuse using the formula: hypotenuse = √(a² + b²)
- Display the calculated hypotenuse value

## Usage:
Run the main class and input the lengths of two perpendicular sides of a right triangle. The program will calculate and display the hypotenuse.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
